# EHR-data
Visualization of EHR data
Based on the code provided, work on synthetic dataset of Electronic Health Records (EHR) has been loaded into a pandas dataframe, and some initial exploratory data analysis has been conducted.

First, the EHR data for a specific patient has been selected and plotted as a patient trajectory over time, showing the medications they have been prescribed.

Next, the three most common conditions in the dataset have been identified and visualized using a bar chart, along with the base cost for medications associated with each condition shown as boxplots.

Finally, the three most common reason codes in the dataset have been identified and visualized using a bar chart.

This code could be a useful starting point for exploring and analyzing the synthetic EHR dataset further, and for developing machine learning models to predict patient outcomes, identify patterns in treatment, and more.
